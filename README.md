# Vision Language Model Fine-Tuning Collection

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for fine-tuning various vision language models using custom datasets.

## What are Vision Language Models?

Vision language models (VLMs) are artificial intelligence systems designed to understand and generate human-like responses based on both text and visual inputs. They combine natural language processing capabilities with computer vision skills, allowing them to interpret images and videos as well as process text.

## Why Fine-Tune Vision Language Models?

Fine-tuning VLMs with custom datasets is crucial for several reasons:

1. Domain-specific expertise: Custom fine-tuning allows models to learn domain-specific concepts and terminology.

2. Improved performance: Tailored training on specific tasks or industries can significantly boost model accuracy.

3. Adaptability: Fine-tuned models can better handle unique challenges and requirements of specific applications.

4. Reduced bias: Custom datasets can help mitigate biases present in pre-trained models.

5. Cost-effective: Instead of training entirely new models from scratch, fine-tuning existing architectures can be more efficient and cost-effective.
